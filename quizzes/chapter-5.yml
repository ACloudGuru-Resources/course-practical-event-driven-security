  question: You received a Macie notification that an IAM secret key has been uploaded to S3. Which of the following are valid remediation actions?
  ​answers:
  - text: Move the secret key to a service better suited for storing secrets, like Secrets Manager.
      correct: true
  - text: Make sure to encrypt the secret in the S3 bucket, using an S3 managed KMS key.
  - text: If possible, delete the IAM user associated with the key, and use a role for your application instead.
      correct: true
  - text: There's no issue storing IAM keys in S3. No remediation actions are needed.
  explanation: If possible, the best approach is not to use IAM keys for your services, and instead use IAM roles. If your service really needs a IAM key, it's best to pull it from a service like Secrets Manager, rather than leaving it in an S3 bucket.
