  question: You've noticed an unusually high amount of traffic coming from a single IP address. How can you limit the number of requests from an IP, without outright blocking the address?
  ​answers:
  - text: Add a rule to your security group denying access to the IP.
  - text: Implement a rate-based rule with AWS WAF.
      correct: true
  - text: Modify a Network ACL to deny traffic from the IP.
  - text: Apply throttling through Route 53
  explanation: Modifying the security group or network ACL would deny all traffic. Route53 doesn't offer a throttling functionality
