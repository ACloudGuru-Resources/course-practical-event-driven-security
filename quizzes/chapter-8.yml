  questiontype​: "1"
  question: True or False? If I have Security Hub enabled, that means my account is already 100% compliant to the CIS Benchmarks?
  ​answers:
  - text: True, so long as you've enabled Security Hub in each region.
  - text: True, so long as you've also enabled Macie and GuardDuty integration.
  - text: False, as Security Hub only monitors a small subsection of the CIS benchmarks.
  - text: False, as Security Hub will monitor compliance, but will not fix issues automatically.
      correct: true
  explanation: False. Security Hub can only monitor, not remediate. There are also a couple CIS Benchmark controls that cannot currently be checked programmatically, and might need to be checked manually. Security Hub does check a very large majority of them though.
