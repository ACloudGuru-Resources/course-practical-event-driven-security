  question: Your organization wants to start being sent an email whenever the root user of an AWS Account logs in. How could you accomplish this?
  ​answers:
  - text: Set up CloudTrail to send its logs to S3. Use AWS Athena to query events performed by the root user.
  - text: Set up Advanced IAM Monitoring in the IAM console.
  - text: Set up MFA on your root user.
  - text: Set up CloudTrail to send its logs to CloudWatch. Use a CloudWatch a Metric Filter and Alarm to filter on events by a root user. Have the Alarm send a notification.
      correct: true
  explanation: Athena can find events made by the root user, but there will be quite a delay and this doesn't report it automatically. Advanced IAM Monitoring isn't a service, unfortunately. Setting up MFA for your root user is a great idea, but doesn't help to monitor activity.

  question: Someone in your organization is complaining that they get too many notifications for AuthorizationFailures. What could you do to decrease the amount of emails, but still be alerted if lots of authorization failures occur?
  ​answers:
  - text: Increase the threshold of the alarm from AuthorizationFailureCount >= 1.
      correct: true
  - text: Remove all subscribers from the SNS Topic.
  - text: Have the person mark the email as spam in their inbox.
  - text: Set the SNS Topic to "Important Only" mode.
  explanation: Increasing the threshold of the alarm is the best solution, as it will help eliminate noise. Removing all subscribers from SNS would make it so nobody received emails. Having the person mark the message as spam just help silence the problem, but doesn't solve it. An "Important Only" mode for SNS might sound like an answer, but isn't something SNS provides.
