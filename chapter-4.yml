  question: You've received a GuardDuty notification that an EC2 instance you have is being used to mine bitcoin, which you didn't intend. What would be a valid remediation step in this case?
  ​answers:
  - text: Add a Security Group rule to the EC2 instance, preventing it from sending its bitcoin results out.
  - text: Use a product that helps detect and remove malware on the instance.
      correct: true
  - text: Rebuild the instance from trusted sources, and ensure that it receives a new key pair.
      correct: true
  - text: Make an AMI of the compromised instance so you don't lose data, and create a new instance from the AMI.
  explanation: Adding a security group might help, but you'll still have malicious software on the instance. This isn't a true fix. Either removing the malware or rebuilding the instance are both better options. Trying to save data by creating an AMI is likely to just move the malware along with your application.

  question: Which of the following best describes GuardDuty pricing?
  ​answers:
  - text: GuardDuty charges you for the amount of CloudTrail logs monitored, but VPC flow logs are free.
  - text: GuardDuty is a flat rate each month, and the amount of events scanned doesn't affect the price.
  - text: GuardDuty charges you based on usage up to $50 each month, but will never charge more than $50.
  - text: GuardDuty charges you based on usage, based on the quantity of CloudTrail and VPC Flow log events monitored.
      correct: true
